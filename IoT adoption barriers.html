<p>Internet of Things is constantly growing. There are more and more objects in our familiar environments that work connected through the network. It makes our everyday activities easier in all areas of our lives: work, family and it also increases the time that we can dedicate to leisure. The consulting firm Gartner estimates that by 2020 there will be more than 20,000 million IoT devices worldwide.</p>

<p>Security

Guaranteeing the privacy of confidential data needs to be an absolute priority, since this technology connects numerous devices that store sensitive personal information. In order to deal with this issue, the equipment manufacturers, as well as software designers and connectivity providers, have to implement strict security requirements when launching new IoT solutions.</p>

<p>Integration

Another challenge facing IoT is its integration with existing technology. All types of devices must modify their architecture to work connected to the cloud and, in many cases, with other gadgets. This implies the implementation of more innovative and complex technology in everyday objects such as watches, washing machines, refrigerators, etc.

The transformation of analogue equipment into digital products that also meet current sustainable energy demands is a challenge. In addition, it must be taken into consideration that the integration of networks and devices with each other increases their interdependence. The existence of multiple interrelated elements makes the failure of only one of the nodes (electric current, Internet connection, components of the devices, etc.) affect the entire system.</p>
